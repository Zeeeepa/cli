# TestDriver.ai

Next generation autonomous AI agent for end-to-end testing of web & desktop

TestDriver isn't like any test framework you've used before. TestDriver uses AI vision along with mouse and keyboard emulation to control the entire desktop. It's more like a QA employee than a test framework.

# Examples

- Test any user flow on any website in any browser
- Clone, build, and test any desktop app
- Render multiple browser windows and popups like 3rd party auth
- Test <canvas>, <iframe>,  and <video> tags with ease
- Use file selectors to upload files to the browser
- Test chrome extensions
- Test integrations between applications
- Integrates into CI/CD via GitHub Actions ($)

## Advantages

TestDriver uses AI to understand what's on the screen, move the mouse and operate the keyboard. This kind of black-box testing has some major advantages:

- **Easier set up:** No need to add test IDs or craft complex selectors
- **Less Maintenance:** Tests don't break when code changes
- **More Power:** TestDriver can test any application and control any OS setting

# How to deploy a test

1. Tell TestDriver what to do in natural language on your local machine using `npm i testdriverai -g` 
2. TestDriver looks at the screen and uses mouse and keyboard emulation to accomplish the goal
3. Run TestDriver tests on our test infrastructure (this github action)
