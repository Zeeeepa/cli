This guide explains how to handle **authentication workflows** in **TestDriver.ai** using GitHub Actions. It covers securely passing credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords) to the TestDriver.ai action and using them in both the `prerun` script and test files.

---

## How Authentication Works in TestDriver.ai

1. **Store Credentials Securely**:
   - Use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or API keys.
2. **Pass Credentials to the Workflow**:
   - Supply credentials as environment variables or directly in the workflow.
3. **Use Credentials in Tests**:
   - Dynamically reference credentials in the `prerun` script or test files to perform authentication steps.

---

## Step 1: Store Credentials in GitHub Secrets

1. Navigate to your repository's **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
2. Add the following secrets:
   - **`TD_USERNAME`**: The username for login.
   - **`TD_PASSWORD`**: The password for login.
   - **`TESTDRIVER_API_KEY`**: Your TestDriver.ai API key.
   - **`WEBSITE_URL`**: The URL of the website to test.

---

## Step 2: Pass Credentials to the Workflow

Secrets are passed to the GitHub Action using the `secrets` context. They can be supplied as:
- **Environment Variables**: Passed via the `env` block.
- **Inline in the `prerun` Script**: Used directly in the script.

### Example Workflow:

```yaml
name: TestDriver.ai / Authentication

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  test-authentication:
    name: Test Authentication
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run Authentication Test
        uses: testdriverai/action@main
        with:
          key: ${{ secrets.TESTDRIVER_API_KEY }}
          prompt: |
            1. Open the login page
            2. Enter the username: ${{ secrets.TD_USERNAME }}
            3. Enter the password: ${{ secrets.TD_PASSWORD }}
            4. Click the "Log In" button
            5. Verify the dashboard is displayed
          prerun: |
            cd $env:TEMP
            npm init -y
            npm install dashcam-chrome
            Start-Process "msedge" -ArgumentList "--start-maximized", "--load-extension=$(pwd)/node_modules/dashcam-chrome/build", "${{ secrets.WEBSITE_URL }}"
            exit
        env:
          TD_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.TD_USERNAME }}
          TD_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.TD_PASSWORD }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          FORCE_COLOR: "3"


```

## Step 3: Use Credentials in Test Files

Secrets can be referenced in the test file using placeholders (e.g., `${TD_USERNAME}` and `${TD_PASSWORD}`).

### Example Test File:

```yaml
version: 4.2.18
steps:
  - prompt: Log in to the application
    commands:
      - command: hover-text
        text: Email
        description: Email input field
        action: click
      - command: type
        text: ${TD_USERNAME}
      - command: hover-text
        text: Password
        description: Password input field
        action: click
      - command: type
        text: ${TD_PASSWORD}
      - command: hover-text
        text: Log In
        description: Log In button
        action: click
      - command: assert
        expect: The dashboard is displayed


```

## How It Works Together

1. **Secrets in the Workflow**:
   - Secrets like `TD_USERNAME` and `TD_PASSWORD` are passed as environment variables to the TestDriver.ai action.

2. **Secrets in the `prerun` Script**:
   - The `WEBSITE_URL` secret is used to launch the browser with the correct URL.

3. **Secrets in the Test File**:
   - The test file dynamically references the secrets to fill in login credentials during the test.

---

## Benefits of Using Authentication in TestDriver.ai

1. **Secure Handling of Credentials**:
   - Secrets are encrypted and not exposed in logs.
   - Even if printed, they appear as `***`.

2. **Dynamic Testing**:
   - Easily switch between different environments (e.g., staging, production) by updating the secrets.

3. **Reusability**:
   - Use the same workflow and test files across multiple repositories or environments.

By securely passing credentials and using them in the `prerun` script and test files, you can automate authentication workflows in TestDriver.ai while ensuring sensitive information remains protected.
