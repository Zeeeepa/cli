# Guide: Using Assertions in TestDriver.ai

Assertions in TestDriver.ai allow you to validate that your application behaves as expected during a test. By using the `assert` command and visual assertions, you can ensure that specific conditions are met, such as verifying the presence of text, images, or UI elements on the screen.

---

## What Are Assertions?

Assertions are checks that validate whether a specific condition is true. If the condition isn't met, the test will fail, providing feedback on what went wrong.

### Types of Assertions in TestDriver.ai:
1. **Text Assertions**: Verify that specific text is visible on the screen.
2. **Visual Assertions**: Validate the presence of images, icons, or UI elements.
3. **Custom Assertions**: Use descriptive conditions to check for specific outcomes.

## How to Use the `assert` Command

The `assert` command is used to validate conditions during a test. It checks whether the specified expectation is true.

### Syntax:

```yaml
- command: assert
  expect: <condition to check>
  async: <true|false> # Optional, defaults to false

```


- **`expect`**: The condition to validate (e.g., "The login form is displayed").
- **`async`**: (Optional) If set to `true`, the test will continue running without waiting for the assertion to pass.

---

### Example: Text Assertion

#### YAML Command:

```yaml
- command: assert
  expect: The login form is displayed

```


This assertion checks if the login form is visible on the screen.

---

### Example: Async Assertion

#### YAML Command:

```yaml
- command: assert
  expect: The success message is displayed
  async: true

```


This assertion runs asynchronously, allowing the test to continue without waiting for the success message to appear.

---

## Visual Assertions

Visual assertions validate the presence of images, icons, or UI elements on the screen. These are particularly useful for verifying non-text elements.

### Example: Verifying an Image

#### YAML Command:

```yaml
- command: hover-image
  description: Company logo in the top-left corner
  action: hover

```


This command hovers over the company logo to ensure it is present on the screen.

---

### Example: Verifying a Button

#### YAML Command:

```yaml
- command: hover-text
  text: Submit
  description: Blue button with the text 'Submit' at the bottom of the form
  action: hover

```


This command hovers over the "Submit" button to confirm its presence.

---

## Combining Assertions with Other Commands

Assertions can be combined with navigation and interaction commands to validate workflows.

### Example: Login Workflow with Assertions

#### YAML Command:

```yaml
version: 4.2.18
steps:
  - prompt: Open the homepage
    commands:
      - command: hover-text
        text: Login
        description: Login button in the top-right corner
        action: click

  - prompt: Verify the login form is displayed
    commands:
      - command: assert
        expect: The login form is displayed

  - prompt: Enter credentials and submit
    commands:
      - command: hover-text
        text: Email
        description: Email input field
        action: click
      - command: type
        text: user@example.com
      - command: hover-text
        text: Password
        description: Password input field
        action: click
      - command: type
        text: password123
      - command: hover-text
        text: Submit
        description: Submit button
        action: click

  - prompt: Verify the dashboard is displayed
    commands:
      - command: assert
        expect: The dashboard is displayed

```

## Debugging Assertions

1. **Review Error Messages**:
   - If an assertion fails, TestDriver.ai provides detailed error messages to help identify the issue.

2. **Use Visual Feedback**:
   - Leverage screenshots and visual feedback to verify the state of the application during the assertion.

3. **Refine Descriptions**:
   - Ensure that the `expect` condition or `description` is specific and matches the application's state.

---

## Best Practices for Assertions

1. **Be Specific**:
   - Use clear and concise conditions for assertions (e.g., "The login form is displayed").

2. **Use Visual Assertions for Non-Text Elements**:
   - Validate images, icons, and other UI elements using `hover-image` or `hover-text`.

3. **Combine Assertions with Navigation**:
   - Place assertions after navigation or interaction steps to validate the application's state.

4. **Leverage Async Assertions**:
   - Use `async: true` for non-blocking checks, especially for dynamic content.

5. **Test Incrementally**:
   - Add assertions step-by-step to validate each part of the workflow.

---

By using the `assert` command and visual assertions effectively, you can create robust and reliable tests that ensure your application behaves as expected.
