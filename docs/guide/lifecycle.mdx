## Pre-run Configuration

If a file is found at `testdriver/lifecycle/prerun.yaml`, it's executed before the test begins. This file works like any other TestDriver file and is commonly used to perform tasks such as opening a browser, navigating to a specific page, or resetting the application state.

For example, the `prerun.yaml` file can be used to open the Chrome browser and navigate to a page, similar to the example provided above. This ensures that the test environment is properly set up before the test starts.

### Example

Here is an example of a `prerun.yaml` file:

```yaml
version: 5.1.1
steps:
  - prompt: launch chrome
    commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: shell
        linux: |
          jumpapp google-chrome --disable-fre --no-default-browser-check --no-first-run "${TD_WEBSITE}" &
          exit
        mac: |
          open -na "Google Chrome" --args --disable-fre --no-default-browser-check --no-first-run --disable-features=PasswordManagerEnabled "${TD_WEBSITE}" &
          exit
        windows:
          Start-Process "C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe" -ArgumentList "--start-maximized", "${TD_WEBSITE}"
          exit
      - command: wait-for-text
        text: "Google Chrome"
        timeout: 30000
```

### Notes

- Currently, there is no teardown task implemented. However, when running on GitHub Actions, the virtual machine (VM) is ephemeral, meaning everything is destroyed after the test run.
