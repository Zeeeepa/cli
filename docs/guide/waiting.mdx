# Waiting in TestDriver.ai: Ensuring Stability and Reducing Flakiness

Waiting is a critical feature in TestDriver.ai that ensures tests are stable and reliable, even in dynamic or slow-loading environments. 


## Summary of Waiting Features

| **Feature**          | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`redraw`(automatic)** | TestDriver automatically waits for UI changes and network activity to resolve. |
| **`wait-for-text`**   | Waits for specific text to appear on the screen.                                |
| **`wait-for-image`**  | Waits for a specific image or visual element to appear on the screen.           |

## Key Waiting Features in TestDriver.ai

1. **Automatic Waiting with `redraw`**:
   - TestDriver.ai automatically waits for the machine before moving to the next step.
   - This includes waiting for:
     - UI changes to complete.
     - Network activity to stabilize (e.g., API calls).
   - Reduces the need for manual waits, making tests faster and less prone to flakiness.

2. **`wait-for-text` Command**:
   - Waits for specific text to appear on the screen.
   - Useful for validating dynamic content or ensuring that a page has fully loaded before proceeding.

3. **`wait-for-image` Command**:
   - Waits for a specific image or visual element to appear on the screen.
   - Ideal for verifying the presence of icons, logos, or other graphical elements.

## Commands for Explicit Waiting

### 1. **`wait-for-text`**

The `wait-for-text` command pauses the test until the specified text appears on the screen. This is particularly useful for dynamic content that takes time to load.

#### Syntax:

```yaml
- command: wait-for-text
  text: <text to wait for>
  timeout: <time in milliseconds> # Optional, defaults to 5000ms
```

#### Example:

```yaml
- command: wait-for-text
  text: Welcome, Test User!
  timeout: 10000
```

In this example, the test waits up to 10 seconds for the text "Welcome, Test User!" to appear.

### 2. **`wait-for-image`**

The `wait-for-image` command pauses the test until the specified image or visual element appears on the screen.

#### Syntax:

```yaml
- command: wait-for-image
  description: <description of the image>
  timeout: <time in milliseconds> # Optional, defaults to 5000ms


```


#### Example:

```yaml
- command: wait-for-image
  description: Company logo in the top-left corner
  timeout: 8000


```

In this example, the test waits up to 8 seconds for the company logo to appear in the top-left corner.

## Automatic Waiting with `redraw`

TestDriver.ai's **`redraw` function** is a built-in mechanism that automatically waits for the screen to stabilize before proceeding to the next step. This includes:

1. **UI Changes**:
   - Waits for animations, transitions, or DOM updates to complete.
   - Ensures that the screen is fully rendered before interacting with elements.

2. **Network Stabilization**:
   - Waits for network activity (e.g., API calls, AJAX requests) to finish.
   - Ensures that dynamic content is fully loaded before proceeding.

3. **Screen Stabilization**:
   - Continuously monitors the screen for changes and only moves forward when the screen is stable.

### How `redraw` Reduces Flakiness

1. **Eliminates Timing Issues**:
   - Automatically adjusts to varying load times, reducing the need for hardcoded delays.

2. **Handles Dynamic Content**:
   - Ensures that tests wait for dynamic elements to appear, reducing false negatives caused by incomplete rendering.

3. **Improves Test Reliability**:
   - By waiting for the screen and network to stabilize, `redraw` minimizes the risk of interacting with incomplete or incorrect elements.

## Combining Waiting Features

You can combine explicit waiting commands (`wait-for-text`, `wait-for-image`) with TestDriver.ai's automatic waiting to create robust and reliable tests.

### Example: Login Workflow with Waiting

```yaml
version: 4.2.18
steps:
  - prompt: Open the login page
    commands:
      - command: hover-text
        text: Login
        description: Login button in the top-right corner
        action: click

  - prompt: Wait for the login form to appear
    commands:
      - command: wait-for-text
        text: Email
        timeout: 10000

  - prompt: Enter credentials and submit
    commands:
      - command: hover-text
        text: Email
        description: Email input field
        action: click
      - command: type
        text: user@example.com
      - command: hover-text
        text: Password
        description: Password input field
        action: click
      - command: type
        text: password123
      - command: hover-text
        text: Submit
        description: Submit button
        action: click

  - prompt: Wait for the dashboard to load
    commands:
      - command: wait-for-text
        text: Welcome, Test User!
        timeout: 15000

  - prompt: Verify the dashboard is displayed
    commands:
      - command: assert
        expect: The dashboard is displayed
```

## Best Practices for Waiting

1. **Use Explicit Waiting for Dynamic Elements**:
   - Use `wait-for-text` or `wait-for-image` for elements that take time to load.

2. **Leverage Automatic Waiting**:
   - Rely on TestDriver.ai's `redraw` function to handle most waiting scenarios automatically.

3. **Avoid Hardcoded Delays**:
   - Replace hardcoded `sleep` or `wait` commands with dynamic waiting commands to improve test reliability.

4. **Set Appropriate Timeouts**:
   - Use reasonable timeouts for explicit waiting commands to balance reliability and test execution time.

5. **Test Incrementally**:
   - Add waiting commands step-by-step to ensure each part of the workflow is stable.
