## Description
The `scroll-until-text` command is used to scroll the screen in a specified direction until the specified text is found. This is useful for navigating to elements that aren't initially visible on the screen.

## Arguments
| Argument    | Type     | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `text`      | `string` | The text to find on the screen. Longer and unique are better.     |
| `direction` | `string` | The direction to scroll. Available directions are: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`. |
| `distance`  | `number` | (Optional) The maximum number of pixels to scroll before giving up. Default is `1200`. |
| `method`    | `enum`   | (Optional) The matching algorithm to use. Possible values are `ai` (default) and `turbo`. |

## Example usage
```yaml
command: scroll-until-text
text: Sign Up
direction: down
```

## Protips
- Use unique and specific text to improve detection accuracy.
- Choose the appropriate `method` for your use case:
  - `ai`: More robust for complex or ambiguous text matching (default).
  - `turbo`: Faster and more efficient for simpler scenarios.
- Adjust the `distance` value to control how far the command scrolls before giving up.

## Gotchas
- If the text can't be located within the specified `distance`, the command will fail.
- Ensure the text is visible and matches exactly, as variations in font size, style, or screen resolution may affect detection accuracy.

## Notes
- The `scroll-until-text` command is ideal for navigating to elements that are off-screen and can't be located using other commands.
- This command supports both vertical and horizontal scrolling for flexible navigation.
