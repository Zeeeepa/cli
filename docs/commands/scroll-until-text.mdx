## Description

The `scroll-until-text` command is used to scroll the screen in a specified direction until the specified text is found. This is useful for navigating to elements that aren't initially visible on the screen.

## Arguments

|  Argument   |   Type   | Description                                                                                                             |
| :---------: | :------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `text`    | `string` | The text to find on the screen. Longer and unique are better. Note this is **case sensitive**                           |
| `direction` | `string` | (Optional) The direction to scroll. Available directions are: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`. Defaults to `down`.        |
|  `method`   | `string` | (Optional) The method to use to scroll the page. Available methods are: `mouse` and `keyboard`. Defaults to `keyboard`. |
| `distance`  | `number` | (Optional) The maximum number of pixels to scroll before giving up. Default is `10000`.                                 |

<Note>
If the method is `keyboard` it just searches for the string by doing `ctrl + f`. 
This is helpful if there is a single string match that you want to operate with.

If you are using `mouse` method, the command will manually scroll the page (based on the `distance`) until the text is found.

</Note>

## Example usage

```yaml
command: scroll-until-text
text: Sign Up
direction: down
distance: 1000
```

## Protips

- Use unique and specific text to improve detection accuracy.
- Adjust the `distance` value to control how far the command scrolls before giving up.
- If you don't specify a `distance`, the command will scroll 300 pixels at a time, giving up after 5 attempts.

## Gotchas

- If the text can't be located within the specified `distance`, the command will fail.
- Ensure the text is visible and matches exactly, as variations in font size, style, or screen resolution may affect detection accuracy.
- Note that `text` is case-sensitive, so **Sign Up** and **sign up** would be treated as different strings.

The `scroll-until-text` command is ideal for navigating to elements that are off-screen and can't be located using other commands.
