## Description
The `assert` command is used to validate that a specific condition is true. It ensures that a task was completed successfully by checking the screen for the expected outcome. If the condition is not met, the test will fail.

## Arguments
| Argument   | Type      | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `expect`   | `string`  | The condition to check. This should describe what you expect to see on the screen. |
| `async`    | `boolean` | (Optional) If set to `true`, the test will continue without waiting for the assertion to pass. Default is `false`. |

## Example Usage
```yaml
command: assert
expect: the video is playing
```

### Example with `async`

```yaml
command: assert
expect: There is no error message
async: true
```

## Notes
- Use `async: true` to speed up tests by allowing non-blocking assertions. However, the test will still fail if the condition is not met.
- Assertions should be used sparingly, as too many can slow down the test execution.
- Ensure the `expect` string clearly describes the condition to avoid ambiguity.
