## Description

The `hover-text` command is used to locate text on the screen based on a description and perform an action on it. This can include hovering, clicking, right-clicking, or double-clicking the text.

## Arguments

|   Argument    |   Type   | Description                                             |
| :-----------: | :------: | :------------------------------------------------------ |
|    `text`     | `string` | The text to find on the screen. Longer and unique is better.   |
| `description` | `string` | A description of the text and what it represents. The actual text itself shouldn't be included here. |
|   `action`    | `string` | The action to take when the text is found. Available actions are: `click`, `right-click`, `double-click`, `hover`. Also supports `drag-start` and `drag-end` for [dragging text](/commands/hover-image#drag-functionality). |
|   `method`    |  `enum`  | The matching algorithm to use. Possible values are `turbo` (default) and `ai`.|
| `timeout`     | `number` | **(Optional)** The duration in milliseconds to wait for the text to appear. Default is `5000` (5 seconds).|

## Example usage

```yaml
command: hover-text
text: Sign Up
description: link in the header
action: click
timeout: 10000 # 10 seconds
```

## Gotchas

- If the text can't be located, it will internally call the [wait-for-text](/commands/wait-for-text) command and wait for the text to appear. The wait `timeout` is 5 seconds by default, and the command fails if the text is not found.
- Variations in font size, style, or screen resolution may affect detection accuracy.

## Notes

- The `hover-text` command is ideal for interacting with textual elements that can't be identified using other selectors.
- Supported actions allow flexibility in how the text is interacted with during the test.
