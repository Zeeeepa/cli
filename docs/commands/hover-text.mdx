## Description

The `hover-text` command is used to locate text on the screen based on a description and perform an action on it. This can include hovering, clicking, right-clicking, or double-clicking the text.

## Arguments

| Argument      | Type     | Description                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `text`        | `string` | The text to find on the screen. Longer and unique is better.                                                       |
| `description` | `string` | A description of the text and what it represents. The actual text itself shouldn't be included here.               |
| `action`      | `string` | The action to take when the text is found. Available actions are: `click`, `right-click`, `double-click`, `hover`. |
| `method`      | `enum`   | The matching algorithm to use. Possible values are `turbo` (default) and `ai`.                                     |

## Example usage

```yaml
command: hover-text
text: Sign Up
description: link in the header
action: click
```

## Protips

- Use unique and specific text to improve detection accuracy.
- Choose the appropriate `method` for your use case:
  - `ai`: More robust for complex or ambiguous text matching (default) using [Set-of-Mark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11441).
  - `levenshtein`: Compare string similarity using [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance).
  - `turbo`: Ideal for simpler scenarios, combining `ai` & `levenshtein`
- Ensure the action specified matches the intended interaction with the text.

## Gotchas

- If the text can't be located, the command will fail. Ensure the text is visible on the screen and matches exactly.
- Variations in font size, style, or screen resolution may affect detection accuracy.

## Notes

- The `hover-text` command is ideal for interacting with textual elements that can't be identified using other selectors.
- Supported actions allow flexibility in how the text is interacted with during the test.
