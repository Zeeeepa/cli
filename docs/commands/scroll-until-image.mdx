## Description
The `scroll-until-image` command is used to scroll the screen in a specified direction until an image matching the given description is found. This is useful for navigating to visual elements that are not initially visible on the screen.

## Arguments
| Argument      | Type     | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `description` | `string` | A description of the image and what it represents.                         |
| `direction`   | `string` | The direction to scroll. Available directions are: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`. |
| `distance`    | `number` | (Optional) The maximum number of pixels to scroll before giving up. Default is `1200`. |

## Example Usage
```yaml
command: scroll-until-image
description: Submit at the bottom of the form
direction: down
```

## Protips
- Use clear and concise descriptions for the image to improve detection accuracy.
- Adjust the `distance` value to control how far the command scrolls before giving up.
- Combine this command with other commands like `hover-image` or `match-image` to interact with the located image.

## Gotchas
- If the image cannot be located within the specified `distance`, the command will fail.
- Ensure the description accurately represents the image to avoid detection issues.

## Notes
- The `scroll-until-image` command is ideal for navigating to visual elements that are off-screen and cannot be located using text-based commands.
- This command supports both vertical and horizontal scrolling for flexible navigation.
