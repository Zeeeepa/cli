## Description

The `wait-for-text` command waits until the specified text is detected on the screen. This is useful for ensuring that textual elements are present before proceeding with the next steps in a test.

## Arguments

| Argument  |   Type   | Description                                                                                            |
| :-------: | :------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  `text`   | `string` | The text to find on the screen.                                                                        |
| `timeout` | `number` | (Optional) The duration in milliseconds to wait for the text to appear. Default is `5000` (5 seconds). |
| `method`  |  `enum`  | (Optional) The matching algorithm to use. Possible values are `ai` and `turbo`. Default is `turbo`     |

## Example usage

```yaml
command: wait-for-text
text: Copyright 2024
timeout: 5000
```

## Protips

- Use unique and specific text to improve detection accuracy.
- Adjust the `timeout` value based on the expected load time of the text to avoid unnecessary delays.

## Gotchas

- If the text doesn't appear within the specified `timeout`, the command will fail.
- Ensure the text matches exactly, as variations in font size, style, or screen resolution may affect detection accuracy.

The `wait-for-text` command is ideal for synchronizing tests with textual elements that may take time to load.
