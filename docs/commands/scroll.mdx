## Description

The `scroll` command is used to scroll the screen in a specified direction using the mouse wheel. This is useful for navigating through content that extends beyond the visible area.

## Arguments

|  Argument   |   Type   | Description                                                                           |
| :---------: | :------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `direction` | `string` | The direction to scroll. Available directions are: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`.     |
|  `method`   | `string` | The method to scroll. Available methods are: `mouse`, `keyboard`. Defaults to `mouse` |
|  `amount`   | `number` | (Optional) Pixels to scroll. If not specified, a default amount of 300 is used.       |

<Warning>
  The `amount` should only be used when the `method` is mouse. If the `method`
  is keyboard, it is redundant as the action performed is pressing the `pageup`
  or `pagedown` keys.
</Warning>

## Example usage

```yaml
- command: scroll
  direction: down
  method: mouse
  amount: 100
```

## Protips

- Be sure to focus the application and frame you are trying to scroll before using the command.
- Use precise `amount` values to control the scrolling distance for better accuracy in your tests.
- Combine the `scroll` command with other commands like `hover-text` or `match-image` to interact with elements that are initially off-screen.
- If you wish to scroll dynamically till a specific text or image appears, use [scroll-until-text](/commands/scroll-until-text) or [scroll-until-image](/commands/scroll-until-image) commands.
- The most reliable way to scroll to the top or bottom of the page is to use the `home` and `end` keys:

  ```yaml
  # Scroll to the top of the page
  - command: press-keys
    keys:
      - home
  # Scroll to the bottom of the page
  - command: press-keys
    keys:
      - end
  ```

## Gotchas

- Scrolling too far may cause elements to move out of view. Adjust the `amount` value as needed.
- Ensure the application or browser window is in focus when using this command to avoid unexpected behavior.

## Notes

- The `scroll` command is ideal for navigating through long pages or lists during automated tests.
- This command supports both vertical and horizontal scrolling for flexible navigation.
