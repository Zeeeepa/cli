## Description

The `remember` command is used to save a variable for later use. This is useful for storing values that you want to reference in subsequent commands or steps, **especially for things that are dynamic or change frequently from run to run**.

## Arguments

|   Argument    |   Type   | Description                                               |
| :-----------: | :------: | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `output`    | `string` | The variable name you will use to recall the value later. |
| `description` | `string` | A prompt describing the value you want to store.          |

## Example usage

```yaml
- command: remember
  description: The date value shown to the right of 'Order Date'
  output: my_variable
```

## Protips

- Use the output later with this syntax `${OUTPUT.my_variable}`.
- The `remember` command does not persist variables across different test runs. If you need to store values for later use in different test runs, consider using external storage solutions or environment variables.
- For now, the `remember` command only supports string values. If you need to store complex data types, you may use `remember` multiple times for the values. This may change in a later version.

## Gotchas

- Ensure the variable name is unique to avoid overwriting existing variables.
- The variable name is case-sensitive, so `my_variable` and `My_Variable` would be treated as different variables.

## Notes

- The `remember` command is ideal for storing values that are generated during the test run, such as timestamps, IDs, the text value of a link you might click later, or any other dynamic data.
