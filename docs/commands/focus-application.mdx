## Description
The `focus-application` command is used to bring a specific application window to the foreground. This ensures that subsequent commands interact with the correct application during a test.

## Arguments
| Argument   | Type      | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`     | `string`  | The name of the application to focus. This should match the application's display name. |

## Example Usage
```yaml
command: focus-application
name: Google Chrome
```

## Protips
- Ensure the application name matches the exact name displayed in your operating system's task manager or application switcher.
- Use this command at the start of a test or before interacting with an application to avoid focus-related issues.

## Gotchas
- If the specified application is not running, the command will fail. Ensure the application is open before using this command.
- On macOS, the application name is case-sensitive.

## Notes
- The `focus-application` command is useful for multi-application workflows where you need to switch between different apps during a test.
- This command is supported on both Windows and macOS environments.
