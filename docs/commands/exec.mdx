## Description
The `exec` command allows you to execute custom NodeJS scripts within your TestDriver.ai tests. This is useful for tasks like generating dynamic data, interacting with APIs, or performing custom logic during a test. The output of the script can be stored in a variable for use in subsequent steps.

## Arguments
| Argument   | Type      | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `lang`     | `string`  | The language of the script to execute. Supported values are `shell` and `js`. |
| `output`   | `string`  | The variable name to store the result of the script. This variable can be accessed as `${OUTPUT.<var>}` in future steps. |
| `silent`   | `string`  | Defaults to `true`. This is useful for suppressing unnecessary or private output in the test logs. If set to `false`, the command will print the output of the script. This is useful for debugging. |
| `linux`    | `string`  | The script to execute on Linux systems. For `js`, the script must define the output as `result`. |
| `windows`  | `string`  | The script to execute on Windows systems. For `js`, the script must define the output as `result`. |
| `mac`      | `string`  | The script to execute on macOS systems. For `js`, the script must define the output as `result`. |

## Example Usage

This example demonstrates how to use the `exec` command to generate a TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) using the `totp-generator` library.

```yaml
version: 5.3.8
steps:
  - commands:
    - command: exec
      lang: shell
      linux: |
        npm install totp-generator
    - command: exec
      lang: js
      output: totp
      linux: |
        const { TOTP } = require("totp-generator");
        let otp = TOTP.generate("JBSWY3DPEB3W64TMMQQQ").otp;
        console.log(otp);
        result = otp;
    - command: type
      text: ${OUTPUT.totp}
```

## Additional Details

- The `exec` command now takes a `lang` argument and supports different operating systems (`linux`, `mac`, and `windows`).
- Supported `lang` values are `js` or `shell`:
  - `js` code is executed in a NodeJS VM on the host machine (your computer).
  - `shell` code is executed in the shell on the runner.
- Code specified in `linux`, `mac`, and `windows` is executed based on the platform of the runner machine.

## Protips

- Overwrite the `result` variable in your script, as it is used to store the output.
- NodeJS code executes in the same context as the calling process on the host machine, using the [VM](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html) module internally.

### TestDriver.ai: Using `exec` Command with Shell and JavaScript

The `exec` command in TestDriver.ai allows you to execute custom shell or JavaScript code during your test runs. This is particularly useful for integrating external APIs, performing complex logic, or interacting with external systems.

---

### **Shell Example: Installing a Node.js Package**

You can use the `exec` command to run shell commands, such as installing a Node.js package.

```yaml
- command: exec
  lang: shell
  linux: |
    npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

Run Steps



**Explanation**:  
This command installs the `@sendgrid/mail` package using `npm`. It is useful when you need to interact with the SendGrid API or other Node.js libraries during your test.

---

### **JavaScript Example: Generating a Temporary Email**

You can use JavaScript to generate a temporary email address dynamically.

```yaml
- command: exec
  lang: js
  output: tempEmail
  linux: |
    const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
    sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);
    const email = `test_${Date.now()}@example.com`;
    console.log(email);
    result = email;
```

Run Steps



**Explanation**:  
This command uses the SendGrid library to generate a unique email address. The `output` field stores the result in a variable (`tempEmail`) for use in subsequent steps.

---

### **Combined Example: Fetching Email and Clicking Links**

You can combine multiple actions, such as fetching email content and interacting with extracted links, into a single JavaScript block.

```yaml
- command: exec
  lang: js
  linux: |
    const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
    sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);
    const email = "${OUTPUT.tempEmail}";
    sgMail.getMessages({ to: email }).then(messages => {
      const links = messages[0].content.match(/https?:\/\/\S+/g);
      console.log("Extracted links:", links);
      links.forEach(link => {
        console.log(`Clicking link: ${link}`);
        // Simulate clicking the link
      });
    });
```

Run Steps



**Explanation**:  
This command:
1. Fetches email messages sent to the generated email address.
2. Extracts all links from the email content using a regular expression.
3. Simulates clicking each link by logging the action.

### **Full YAML Example**

Hereâ€™s a complete example combining shell and JavaScript commands:

```yaml
version: 5.3.8
steps:
  - commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: shell
        linux: |
          npm install @sendgrid/mail
      - command: exec
        lang: js
        output: tempEmail
        linux: |
          const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
          sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);
          const email = `test_${Date.now()}@example.com`;
          console.log(email);
          result = email;
  - prompt: Enter the generated email into the email field
    commands:
      - command: hover-text
        text: Email address
        description: email input field label
        action: click
      - command: type
        text: ${OUTPUT.tempEmail}
  - prompt: Wait for an email, extract links, and click each link
    commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: js
        linux: |
          const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
          sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);
          const email = "${OUTPUT.tempEmail}";
          sgMail.getMessages({ to: email }).then(messages => {
            const links = messages[0].content.match(/https?:\/\/\S+/g);
            console.log("Extracted links:", links);
            links.forEach(link => {
              console.log(`Clicking link: ${link}`);
              // Simulate clicking the link
            });
          });
```

Run Steps



---

### Key Points:
1. **Shell Commands**: Use `lang: shell` for executing terminal commands like installing packages or running scripts.
2. **JavaScript Commands**: Use `lang: js` for more complex logic, such as interacting with APIs or processing data.
3. **Output Variables**: Use the `output` field to store results from `exec` commands for use in later steps.

---

### Use Cases:
- **API Integration**: Fetch data from external APIs and use it in your tests.
- **Dynamic Data**: Generate unique data (e.g., email addresses) for each test run.
- **Custom Logic**: Perform advanced operations that are not natively supported by TestDriver.ai.

By combining shell and JavaScript commands, you can extend the functionality of TestDriver.ai to handle complex workflows seamlessly.
