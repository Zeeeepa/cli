## Description

The `exec` command allows you to execute custom Node.js scripts within your TestDriver tests. This is useful for tasks like generating dynamic data, interacting with APIs, or performing custom logic during a test. The output of the script can be stored in a variable for use in subsequent steps. It's important to note that the output from `exec` must be a `string`.

## Arguments

| Argument |   Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :------: | :------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  `lang`  | `string` | The language of the script to execute. Supported values are `pwsh` and `js`.                                                                                                       |
| `output` | `string` | The variable name to store the result of the script. This variable can be accessed as `${OUTPUT.<var>}` in future steps.                                                           |
|  `code`  | `string` | The script to execute on Windows systems. For `js`, the script must define the output as `result`.                                                                                 |
| `silent` | `string` | Defaults to `false`. The command will print the output of the script. This is useful for suppressing unnecessary or private output in the test logs and it's useful for debugging. |

## Example usage

This example demonstrates how to use the `exec` command to generate a TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) using the `totp-generator` library.

```yaml otp-generator.yaml
version: 6.0.0
steps:
  - commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: pwsh
        code: |
          npm install totp-generator
      - command: exec
        lang: js
        output: totp
        code: |
          const { TOTP } = require("totp-generator");
          let otp = TOTP.generate("JBSWY3DPEB3W64TMMQQQ").otp;
          console.log(otp);
          result = otp;
      - command: type
        text: ${OUTPUT.totp}
```

## Additional details

- Supported `lang` values are `js` or `pwsh`:
  - `js` code is executed in a Node.js [VM](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html) internally on the host machine (for example the machine where your CI/CD runs, or your computer if using the local agent).
  - `pwsh` code is executed in the shell on target runner (which can be the cloud runner, local sandbox, or local machine, depending on where you run your tests).
    - **Note:** You can also use `pwsh` in [lifecycle](/guide/lifecycle) scripts to install npm packages if you need them.
    - Otherwise, the `pwsh` code can be used within test steps to launch applications or perform simple commands (like writing text to a file on the machine to perform a simple file upload).
- The `output`argument is assigned automatically by setting `result = somestringvalue` in the script you run.

## Protips

- The `result` variable is already available in your script, overwrite it to store the output as shown in the examples.
- Do any handling of arrays or nested objects within your `js` script:
  - ✅ `result = users[1].profile.firstName`
  - ✅ `result = data.length > 0 ? data[0].userEmail : 'no user found'` if no data is found the value of output will be `null`
  - ✅ `result = someTestUserEmail`
  - ✅ `result = someTextToAssert`
  - ✅ `result = someDescriptionOfAnImageToScrollTo`
- Don't try to pass any non-string values to `output`:
  - ❌ `result = [...users, ...values]`
  - ❌ `result = {name: "Dale Earnhardt", starts: 676, wins: 76}`
  - ❌ `result = [{user1: ...}, {user2: ...}]`

## Ways to use `exec`

Here is an example using both `pwsh` and `js` contexts within a `prerun.yaml` script which creates a temporary email account and automatically clicks links found in received emails.

```yaml ./lifecycle/prerun.yaml [expandable]
version: 6.0.0
steps:
  - commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: pwsh
        code: |
          npm install @sendgrid/mail
      - command: exec
        lang: js
        output: accountData
        code: |
          const Mailjs = require("@cemalgnlts/mailjs");
          const mailjs = new Mailjs();
          let account = await mailjs.createOneAccount()
          console.log("Account created:", account);
          result = JSON.stringify(account.data)
      - command: exec
        lang: js
        output: emailAddress
        code: |
          const accountData = ${OUTPUT.accountData};
          result = accountData.username
  - prompt: Enter the generated email into the email field
    commands:
      - command: hover-text
        text: standard_user
        description: email input field label
        action: click
      - command: type
        text: ${OUTPUT.emailAddress}
  - prompt: Wait for an email, extract links, and open each link
    commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: js
        code: |
          const Mailjs = require("@cemalgnlts/mailjs");
          const { JSDOM } = require('jsdom'); // To parse HTML and extract links

          const accountData = ${OUTPUT.accountData};

          const getLatestEmailAndClickLinks = async () => {
            try {
              // Initialize the Mailjs client
              const mailjs = new Mailjs();

              // Login to your account
              await mailjs.login(accountData.username, accountData.password);

              // Fetch list of messages
              const messages = await mailjs.getMessages();

              if (messages.length === 0) {
                console.log('No emails found.');
                return;
              }

              // Assuming the latest email is the first one in the list
              const latestMessage = messages[0];

              // Fetch the full details of the latest email
              const fullMessage = await mailjs.getMessage(latestMessage.id);

              console.log('Latest Email Details:', fullMessage);

              // Parse the HTML content to extract links
              const dom = new JSDOM(fullMessage.html);
              const links = Array.from(dom.window.document.querySelectorAll('a')).map(a => a.href);

              console.log('Found Links:', links);

              // Click (fetch) every link using native fetch
              for (const link of links) {
                try {
                  const response = await fetch(link);
                  console.log('Clicked ${link}: ${response.status}');
                } catch (linkError) {
                  console.error('Error clicking ${link}:', linkError);
                }
              }

            } catch (error) {
              console.error('Error fetching latest email or clicking links:', error);
            }
          };

          getLatestEmailAndClickLinks();
```

### Using `exec` pwsh commands in a test file

In a test file, you can use the `pwsh` context directly:

```yaml calculator.yaml highlight={5-8} [expandable]
version: 6.0.0
steps:
  - prompt: launch a calculator
    commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: pwsh
        code: |
          start /B calc.exe
          timeout /t 5
      - command: wait-for-text
        text: "calculator"
        timeout: 30000
  - prompt: performing the operation 2 + 2 = on the calculator that is opened
    commands:
      - command: focus-application
        name: galculator
      - command: hover-image
        description: button with number 2 on the calculator
        action: click
      - command: hover-image
        description: plus button on the calculator
        action: click
      - command: hover-image
        description: button with number 2 on the calculator
        action: click
      - command: hover-image
        description: equals button on the calculator
        action: click
```

### One more option

You can also save reusable snippets (like launching the calculator) to be inserted into a script later with the [`run`](/commands/run) command. That version would look something like this:

```yaml snippets/launch-calculator.yaml [expandable]
version: 6.0.0
steps:
  - prompt: launch a calculator
    commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: pwsh
        code: |
        start /B calc.exe
          timeout /t 5
      - command: wait-for-text
        text: "calculator"
        timeout: 30000
```

Then in the test:

```yaml calculator.yaml highlight={5-6} [expandable]
version: 6.0.0
steps:
  - prompt: launch a calculator
    commands:
      - command: run
        file: snippets/launch-calculator.yaml
  - prompt: performing the operation 2 + 2 = on the calculator that is opened
    commands:
      - command: focus-application
        name: galculator
      - command: hover-image
        description: button with number 2 on the calculator
        action: click
      - command: hover-image
        description: plus button on the calculator
        action: click
      - command: hover-image
        description: button with number 2 on the calculator
        action: click
      - command: hover-image
        description: equals button on the calculator
        action: click
```

### Don't try to run `js` within a test field

This example will fail at runtime, so don't try to execute `js` context directly in a test file. Remember - use this in `prerun` to setup your test!

```yaml badtestfile.yaml [expandable]
version: 6.0.0
commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: pwsh
        code: |
          npm install -g axios json2csv
  - prompt: fetch user data from API
    commands:
      - command: exec
        output: user
        lang: js
        code: |
          const axios = require('axios');
          const { Parser } = require('json2csv');
          const fs = require('fs');

          const response = await axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
          const parser = new Parser();
          const csv = parser.parse(response.data);
          fs.writeFileSync('users.csv', csv);
          const user = response.data[0].name;
          result = user;
          console.log('username', user);
    ...
```

This example will produce errors in the TestDriver output or CLI since the runner won't have access to the Node.js VM context.
