## Gotchas
- Key mappings may differ between operating systems. For example, `command` on macOS is remapped to `ctrl` on Windows.
- Ensure the application or system is in focus when using this command to avoid unexpected behavior.

## Notes
- The `press-keys` command is ideal for automating workflows that rely on keyboard shortcuts.
