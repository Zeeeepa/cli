## Overview
Prerun scripts are commands executed on a TestDriver virtual machine (VM) before each test in a CI/CD pipeline. They are used to prepare the environment by provisioning the VM, installing dependencies, configuring settings, or building the application. This ensures a consistent and reproducible environment for every test execution.

By using prerun scripts, you can:
- Speed up test setup.
- Prevent test failures caused by inconsistent environments.
- Promote reproducible builds for reliable test results.

---

## Use Cases
Prerun scripts are ideal for:
- Installing necessary dependencies (e.g., browsers, libraries, or tools).
- Building your application or running setup scripts.
- Configuring the VM to match specific test requirements.
- Preparing staging environments or accessing private resources.

## Example: Installing Arc Browser
The following example demonstrates how to use a prerun script to download and install the Arc Browser on a Windows VM before running tests.

```yaml
# permissions and other setup here

jobs:
  test:
    name: "TestDriver"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Use the TestDriver GitHub Action
      - uses: testdriverai/action@main
        with:
          prerun: |
            # Get the IPv6 address of the VM
            Get-NetIPAddress -AddressFamily IPv6
            # URL for the Arc browser installer
            $installerUrl = "https://releases.arc.net/windows/ArcInstaller.exe"
            # Location to save the installer
            $installerPath = "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\ArcInstaller.exe"
            # Download the Arc browser installer
            Write-Host "Downloading Arc browser installer..."
            Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $installerUrl -OutFile $installerPath
            # Check if the download was successful
            if (Test-Path $installerPath) {
                Write-Host "Download successful. Running the installer..."
                Start-Process -FilePath $installerPath -ArgumentList '/silent' -Wait
                Start-Sleep -Seconds 10
            } else {
                Write-Host "Failed to download the Arc browser installer."
            }
```

## Key Points
- **Provisioning**: Prerun scripts allow you to provision the VM with the necessary tools and configurations before running tests.
- **Reproducibility**: By ensuring a consistent environment, prerun scripts help prevent flaky tests caused by environmental differences.
- **Flexibility**: You can use prerun scripts to customize the VM for specific test scenarios, such as installing alternative browsers or setting up staging environments.

---

## Best Practices
- **Keep It Simple**: Write clear and concise prerun scripts to minimize setup time and reduce complexity.
- **Error Handling**: Include checks to verify that dependencies are installed successfully. Log errors to help debug issues.
- **Optimize Performance**: Cache dependencies or use lightweight tools to speed up the setup process.
- **Security**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in prerun scripts. Use GitHub secrets to securely pass credentials or tokens.

---

## Notes
- Prerun scripts are executed on the VM before the test suite begins.
- They are essential for ensuring a consistent and reliable test environment.
- For advanced workflows, combine prerun scripts with TestDriver prompts to create dynamic and flexible test setups.
