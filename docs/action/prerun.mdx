## Overview
Prerun scripts are commands executed on a TestDriver virtual machine (VM) before each test in a CI/CD pipeline. They are used to prepare the environment by provisioning the VM, installing dependencies, configuring settings, or building the application. This ensures a consistent and reproducible environment for every test execution.

By using prerun scripts, you can:
- Speed up test setup.
- Prevent test failures caused by inconsistent environments.
- Promote reproducible builds for reliable test results.

---

## Use Cases
Prerun scripts are ideal for:
- Installing necessary dependencies (for example, browsers, libraries, or tools).
- Building your application or running setup scripts.
- Configuring the VM to match specific test requirements.
- Preparing staging environments or accessing private resources.

## Example: Installing Arc Browser
The following example demonstrates how to use a prerun script to download and install the Arc Browser on a Windows VM before running tests.

```yaml
# permissions and other setup here

jobs:
  test:
    name: "TestDriver"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Use the TestDriver GitHub Action
      - uses: testdriverai/action@main
        with:
          prerun: |
            # Get the IPv6 address of the VM
            Get-NetIPAddress -AddressFamily IPv6
            # URL for the Arc browser installer
            $installerUrl = "https://releases.arc.net/windows/ArcInstaller.exe"
            # Location to save the installer
            $installerPath = "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\ArcInstaller.exe"
            # Download the Arc browser installer
            Write-Host "Downloading Arc browser installer..."
            Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $installerUrl -OutFile $installerPath
            # Check if the download was successful
            if (Test-Path $installerPath) {
                Write-Host "Download successful. Running the installer..."
                Start-Process -FilePath $installerPath -ArgumentList '/silent' -Wait
                Start-Sleep -Seconds 10
            } else {
                Write-Host "Failed to download the Arc browser installer."
            }
```

## Example: Loading a Calculator App on Linux, Mac or Windows
```yaml
version: 5.5.5
session: 67f00511acbd9ccac373edf7
steps:
  - prompt: launch a calculator
    commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: shell
        linux: |
          linux: |
            jumpapp /usr/bin/galculator > /dev/null 2>&1 &
            exit
        mac: |
          open "/Applications/Calculator.app"
          wait
        windows:
          start /B calc.exe
          timeout /t 5
      - command: wait-for-text
        text: "galculator"
        timeout: 30000
```

## Key Points
- **Provisioning**: Prerun scripts allow you to provision the VM with the necessary tools and configurations before running tests.
- **Reproducibility**: By ensuring a consistent environment, prerun scripts help prevent flaky tests caused by environmental differences.
- **Flexibility**: You can use prerun scripts to customize the VM for specific test scenarios, such as installing alternative browsers or setting up staging environments.

---

## Best Practices
- **Keep It Simple**: Write clear and concise prerun scripts to minimize setup time and reduce complexity.
- **Error Handling**: Include checks to verify that dependencies are installed successfully. Log errors to help debug issues.
- **Optimize Performance**: Cache dependencies or use lightweight tools to speed up the setup process.
- **Security**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in prerun scripts. Use GitHub secrets to securely pass credentials or tokens.

## A Note on the Default Prerun Script
When setting up your TestDriver environment, a default prerun script is automatically generated. This script includes essential commands to ensure your VM is ready for testing. You can customize this script to suit your specific needs, but it's important to understand that it serves as a baseline for your test environment. It looks like this:

```yaml
version: 5.1.1
session: 67f00511acbd9ccac373edf7
steps:
  - prompt: launch chrome
    commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: shell
        linux: |
          jumpapp google-chrome --disable-fre --no-default-browser-check --no-first-run "${TD_WEBSITE}" &
          exit
        mac: |
          open -na "Google Chrome" --args --disable-fre --no-default-browser-check --no-first-run --disable-features=PasswordManagerEnabled "${TD_WEBSITE}" &
          exit
        windows:
          Start-Process "C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe" -ArgumentList "--start-maximized", "${TD_WEBSITE}"
          exit
      - command: wait-for-text
        text: "Google Chrome"
        timeout: 30000
```

Take note that it defaults to launching the Chrome browser. If you want to use a different browser, you can modify the `prompt` and `commands` sections accordingly. 

<Warning>
The `wait-For-text` command is crucial for ensuring that the browser is fully loaded before proceeding with the test steps. If you are testing a webapplication, you may want to adjust the `text` parameter to match the expected title or content of the page.
</Warning>


## Notes
- Prerun scripts are executed on the VM before the test suite begins.
- They are essential for ensuring a consistent and reliable test environment.
- For advanced workflows, combine prerun scripts with TestDriver prompts to create dynamic and flexible test setups.
