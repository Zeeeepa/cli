Auto-healing is a powerful feature in TestDriver.ai that ensures your tests remain resilient even when the application under test changes. 

When TestDriver steps fail, the AI will progressively fall back to attemp to complete the test.

If running on CI, TestDriver will open a pull request (PR) with the updated test, ensuring your test suite stays up-to-date with minimal manual intervention.

## Benefits of Auto-Healing

- **Reduced Maintenance**: Eliminates the need for manual updates to tests when minor UI changes occur.
- **Increased Test Resilience**: Ensures tests adapt to changes without breaking.
- **Continuous Integration**: Keeps your test suite aligned with the latest application changes.
- **Developer Collaboration**: Automatically opens a PR, allowing developers to review and approve updates.

## How Auto-Healing Works

1. **Test Execution**: TestDriver.ai runs your test suite as usual.
2. **Failure Detection**: If a test fails due to a change in the application (e.g., text or UI updates), the AI identifies the failure point.
3. **Recovery Attempt**: The AI uses its adaptive capabilities to locate the updated element or text and retries the action.
4. **Test Update**: If the recovery is successful, TestDriver.ai updates the test script with the new element or text.
5. **Pull Request Creation**: The updated test script is committed to a new branch, and a pull request is automatically opened in your repository for review.

### Example: Button Text Changes from "Submit" to "Send"

1. **Initial Test**:

```yaml {2}
- command: hover-text
  text: Submit
  description: Submit button in the form
  action: click
```

2. **Application Update**:
  - The button text is changed from "Submit" to "Send" in the application.

3. **Test Execution**:
  - TestDriver.ai runs the test and fails to find the "Submit" button.

4. **Auto-Healing**:
  - The AI detects the failure and searches for a similar element.
  - It identifies the "Send" button as the updated element and retries the action.

5. **Test Update**:
  - The test script is updated to reflect the new button text:
  
  ```yaml {2}
  - command: hover-text
    text: Send
    description: Submit button in the form
    action: click
  ```

6. **Pull Request Creation**:
   - TestDriver.ai commits the updated test to a new branch and opens a PR:
     - **Branch Name**: `auto-heal-update-submit-to-send`
     - **PR Title**: `Auto-Healed Test: Updated "Submit" to "Send"`

## Example GitHub Action for Auto-Healing

Hereâ€™s how you can configure a GitHub Action to enable auto-healing and PR creation:

```yaml {24-30} 
name: TestDriver.ai Auto-Healing

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  test:
    name: "Run Tests with Auto-Healing"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run TestDriver.ai
        uses: testdriverai/action@main
        with:
          key: ${{ secrets.TESTDRIVER_API_KEY }}
          prompt: |
            1. /run testdriver/onboarding.yaml --save
          create-pr: true
          pr-title: "Auto-Healed Test Updates"
          pr-base: main
          pr-branch: auto-heal-updates
```

## Limitations of Auto-Healing

- **Major UI Overhauls**: Auto-healing is best suited for minor changes (e.g., text updates, small layout adjustments). Significant UI changes may still require manual intervention.
- **Ambiguous Changes**: If multiple elements match the updated criteria, the AI may require additional context to make the correct decision.
- **Step Deletion**: If UI or wizard pages are removed, the AI may not be able to recover. In such cases, manual updates are necessary.
