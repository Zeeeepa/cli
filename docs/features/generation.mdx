TestDriver.ai provides a powerful and flexible framework for generating tests from various sources, including:
- **TestRail test cases**
- **CSV files**
- **Jira tickets**
- **Gherkin scenarios**

Additionally, TestDriver.ai can autonomously generate its own tests by recursively mapping the UI and exploring workflows.

## **Test Generation from CSV Files**

### Workflow Overview
CSV files are a simple and structured way to define test cases. Each row in the CSV file can represent a test case, with columns specifying the test steps, expected outcomes, or other metadata.

### Example CSV Structure:

| Test Name         | Step 1                  | Step 2                  | Step 3                  | Expected Outcome         |
|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Login Test         | Open login page         | Enter valid credentials | Click "Log In" button   | Dashboard is displayed   |
| Invalid Login Test | Open login page         | Enter invalid credentials | Click "Log In" button | Error message is shown   |

### Conversion to TestDriver.ai YAML
A script can parse the CSV file and convert each row into a YAML test file.

#### Example YAML for "Login Test":```yaml
version: 4.2.18
steps:
  - prompt: Open login page
  - prompt: Enter valid credentials
  - prompt: Click "Log In" button
  - prompt: Verify that the dashboard is displayed

```

#### Automation Script
Use a Node.js or Python script to automate the conversion process. The script reads the CSV file, extracts the test cases, and generates YAML files for each test.

## 2. **Test Generation from Jira Tickets**

### Workflow Overview
Jira tickets often contain **user stories** or **acceptance criteria** that can be converted into test cases. By using the Jira API, you can fetch tickets and extract relevant fields like the title, description, and acceptance criteria.

### Example Jira Ticket:
- **Title**: Login functionality
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The user can log in with valid credentials.
  - An error message is displayed for invalid credentials.
  - The login page is responsive on mobile devices.

### Conversion to TestDriver.ai YAML
Each acceptance criterion can be converted into a `prompt` in a YAML test file.

#### Example YAML:```yaml
version: 4.2.18
steps:
  - prompt: The user can log in with valid credentials.
  - prompt: An error message is displayed for invalid credentials.
  - prompt: The login page is responsive on mobile devices.

```

#### Automation Script
Use a script to fetch Jira tickets via the Jira API, extract the acceptance criteria, and generate YAML files.

## 3. **Test Generation from Gherkin Scenarios**

### Workflow Overview
Gherkin scenarios, commonly used with tools like Cucumber, describe test cases in a human-readable format using keywords like `Given`, `When`, and `Then`.

### Example Gherkin Scenario:```gherkin
Scenario: Successful login
  Given the user is on the login page
  When the user enters valid credentials
  And clicks the "Log In" button
  Then the user should see the dashboard

```### Conversion to TestDriver.ai YAML
Each Gherkin step can be mapped to a `prompt` in a YAML test file.

#### Example YAML:```yaml
version: 4.2.18
steps:
  - prompt: The user is on the login page
  - prompt: The user enters valid credentials
  - prompt: Clicks the "Log In" button
  - prompt: The user should see the dashboard

```

#### Automation Script
A script can parse Gherkin files, map the steps to prompts, and generate YAML files.

## 4. **Test Generation from TestRail**

### Workflow Overview
TestRail is a popular test management tool. You can use the TestRail API to fetch test cases and convert them into TestDriver.ai YAML files.

### Example TestRail Test Case:
- **Title**: Login Test
- **Steps**:
  1. Open the login page.
  2. Enter valid credentials.
  3. Click the "Log In" button.
- **Expected Result**: The dashboard is displayed.

### Conversion to TestDriver.ai YAML
Each step becomes a `prompt`, and the expected result can be added as an assertion.

#### Example YAML:```yaml
version: 4.2.18
steps:
  - prompt: Open the login page
  - prompt: Enter valid credentials
  - prompt: Click the "Log In" button
  - prompt: Verify that the dashboard is displayed

```

#### Automation Script
A script can fetch test cases from TestRail, extract the steps and expected results, and generate YAML files.

## 5. **AI-Driven Exploratory Testing**

### Workflow Overview
TestDriver.ai can autonomously generate tests by exploring the UI and mapping workflows. This is particularly useful for:
- Discovering untested paths.
- Validating dynamic or complex UIs.
- Generating tests for new features without requiring manual input.

### How It Works:
1. **Recursive UI Mapping**: The AI navigates through the application, identifying clickable elements, input fields, and other interactive components.
2. **Test Generation**: The AI generates test cases based on the discovered workflows, including actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, and verifying outcomes.
3. **Self-Healing**: If the UI changes, the AI adapts the tests to match the new structure.

### Example AI-Generated Test:
For a login page, the AI might generate the following test:


### Benefits:
- **No Manual Input Required**: The AI generates tests automatically.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: The AI explores all possible paths, ensuring thorough testing.
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Tests are updated automatically when the UI changes.
