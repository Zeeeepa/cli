## How Do I Test Chrome Extensions?
TestDriver provides a powerful solution for testing Chrome extensions. With our platform, you can easily create and run tests to ensure your extension functions as expected across different browsers and operating systems.
## Getting Started
You can test a preinstalled extension or test by installing an extension. If the extension is in developemt mode, turn this on by checking the "Developer mode" checkbox in the Chrome extensions page. From there you can load the unpacked extension by selecting the folder where your extension is located. To download the files onto the VM if you are performing a test on cloud hosted runners, see the [Lifecycle](/guide/lifecycle) or [Prerun](/action/prerun) docs.

## Sample Test Steps
1. Load a the Chrome Web Store.
2. Search for the extension you want to test.
3. Click on the extension to open its details page.
4. Click on the "Add to Chrome" button to install the extension.
5. Wait for the installation to complete.
6. Click the 'puzzle piece' icon to pin the extension to the toolbar.
7. Click on the extension icon to open it.
