> [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) is a framework for building tiny, fast binaries for all major desktop and mobile platforms. Developers can integrate any frontend framework that compiles to HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for building their user experience while leveraging languages such as Rust, Swift, and Kotlin for backend logic when needed.

## Testing Tauri apps with TestDriver

In this guide, we'll leverage [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and the
[TestDriver Playwright SDK](/getting-started/playwright) to convert the [Tauri Quick Start](https://tauri.app/start/create-project/)
to TestDriver's selectorless, Vision AI.

## Testing the Tauri Web App

### Setup

First, we need to modify the default Playwright configuration and our Tauri project to work together:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Playwright to start the Tauri frontend">

    In the `playwright.config.ts` file, we'll configure the [`webServer`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver)
    to start the Tauri frontend for Playwright to test against:

    ```typescript playwright.config.ts
      /* Run your local dev server before starting the tests */
      // [!code ++:8]
      webServer: {
        command: "npm run dev",
        url: "http://localhost:1420",
        reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
        env: {
          VITE_PLAYWRIGHT: "true",
        },
      },
    });
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Mock Tauri APIs">

    Since we're testing the Tauri frontend, we need to [mock IPC Requests](https://tauri.app/develop/tests/mocking/)
    to simulate `invoke` calls to the Rust backend:

    ```html src/index.html
    <body>
      <div id="root"></div>
      <!-- [!code ++:7] -->
      <script type="module">
        // This is set in playwright.config.ts to allow our tests to mock Tauri IPC `invoke` calls
        if (import.meta.env.VITE_PLAYWRIGHT) {
          const { mockIPC } = await import("@tauri-apps/api/mocks");
          window.mockIPC = mockIPC;
        }
      </script>
      <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
    </body>
    ```

    We only need to do this once, as we'll be accessing `window.mockIPC` in our tests.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new test file">
    Create a new file (e.g. `tests/testdriver.spec.ts`) with:

    ```typescript tests/testdriver.spec.ts
    import type { mockIPC } from "@tauri-apps/api/mocks";
    import { expect, test } from "@playwright/test";

    test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto("http://localhost:1420");
    });

    test("should have title", async ({ page }) => {
      await expect(page).toHaveTitle("Tauri + React + TypeScript");
    });
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Playwright in UI Mode">

    Now we're ready to run Playwright and start working on our tests:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="npm">

        ```bash
        npx playwright test --ui
        ```

      </Tab>
      <Tab title="yarn">

        ```bash
        yarn playwright test --ui
        ```

      </Tab>
      <Tab title="pnpm">

        ```bash
        pnpm exec playwright test --ui
        ```

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    ![Playwright UI Mode](https://playwright.dev/assets/ideal-img/ui-mode.4e54d6b.3598.png)

    Click the <Icon icon="play" /> button to successfully run the tests in the UI.

    <Tip>
      Click the <Icon icon="eye" /> button to automatically re-run tests on save.

  </Step>

</Steps>

### Usage

#### Import the TestDriver Playwright SDK

By changing **1 line**, we can add TestDriver's AI capabilities to Playwright:

```typescript tests/testdriver.spec.ts
import type { mockIPC } from "@tauri-apps/api/mocks";
// [!code --]
import { expect, test } from "@playwright/test";
// [!code ++]
import { expect, test } from "@testdriver.ai/playwright";

// For type-safety of the mockIPC function
declare global {
  interface Window {
    mockIPC: typeof mockIPC;
  }
}

test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("http://localhost:1420");
});

test("should have title", async ({ page }) => {
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle("Tauri + React + TypeScript");
});
```

Notice how we're able to continue using Playwright's API (`toHaveTitle`)
with `@testdriver.ai/playwright`.

The test continues to pass as before, so now we can update our test to use natural language instead of selectors.

#### Assertions with `expect.toMatchPrompt`

With Playwright, we would normally use a `getByRole` selector to assert the heading text:

```typescript tests/example.spec.ts
test("should have heading", async ({ page }) => {
  await expect(
    page.getByRole("heading", { name: "Installation" }),
  ).toBeVisible();
});
```

With TestDriver, we can use natural language with `toMatchPrompt` instead:

```typescript tests/testdriver.spec.ts
test("should have heading", async ({ page }) => {
  // [!code --:3]
  await expect(
    page.getByRole("heading", { name: "Installation" }),
  ).toBeVisible();
  // [!code ++:1]
  await expect(page).toMatchPrompt("Heading says 'Welcome to Tauri + React'");
});
```

#### Agentic tests with `test.agent`

With TestDriver, we can skip the test implementation **entirely** and let AI perform the test for us:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mock the `greet` call">

    First, we need to [mock our `invoke` calls](https://tauri.app/develop/tests/mocking/#ipc-requests),
    since we're testing the frontend behavior and not our Tauri backend:

    ```typescript tests/testdriver.spec.ts
    test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto("http://localhost:1420");
      // [!code ++:12]
      await page.evaluate(() => {
        // https://tauri.app/develop/tests/mocking/#mocking-commands-for-invoke
        window.mockIPC((cmd, args) => {
          switch (cmd) {
            case "greet":
              args = args as { name: string };
              return `Hello, ${args.name}! You've been greeted from Rust!`;
            default:
              throw new Error(`Unsupported command: ${cmd}`);
          }
        });
      });
    });
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add an Agentic Test">

    Next, wrap a _prompt_ in `test.agent` to perform the test:

    ```typescript tests/testdriver.spec.ts
    test.describe("should greet with name", () => {
      test.agent(`
        - Enter the name "Tauri"
        - Click the "Greet" button
        - You should see the text "Hello, Tauri! You've been greeted from Rust!"
      `);
    });
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>
