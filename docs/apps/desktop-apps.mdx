## Installation
To use TestDriver with desktop applications, no special setup is needed. Simply run the local agent to interact with applications on your local machine, or add instructions to `prerun.yaml` to tell the runner to launch or install the application. Here is an example that performs a calculation on a calculator app:
```yaml
version: 5.5.5
session: 67f00511acbd9ccac373edf7
steps:
  - prompt: launch a calculator
    commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: shell
        linux: |
          linux: |
            jumpapp /usr/bin/galculator > /dev/null 2>&1 &
            exit
        mac: |
          open "/Applications/Calculator.app"
          wait
        windows:
          start /B calc.exe
          timeout /t 5
      - command: wait-for-text
        text: "calculator"
        timeout: 30000
```

A `calculator_test.yaml` file might look like this:
```yaml
version: 5.5.5
session: 6810141e0e064b42739922f2
steps:
  - prompt: /try performing the operation 2 + 2 = on the calculator that is opened
    commands:
      - command: focus-application
        name: galculator
      - command: hover-image
        description: button with number 2 on the calculator
        action: click
      - command: hover-image
        description: plus button on the calculator
        action: click
      - command: hover-image
        description: button with number 2 on the calculator
        action: click
      - command: hover-image
        description: equals button on the calculator
        action: click
```
