title: "Selectorless Testing"
---

Selectorless testing is a revolutionary approach to end-to-end testing that eliminates the need for brittle selectors like CSS classes, IDs, or XPath. Instead, TestDriver uses natural language prompts and AI-powered vision to interact with applications as a user would. This makes tests more resilient to UI changes and reduces maintenance overhead.

## Why Selectorless Testing?

Traditional testing frameworks rely on selectors tightly coupled to the codebase. For example:

```javascript
const button = await page.$('button[class="sign-up-btn"]');
```

If the class name changes, the test will break, requiring updates to the test code. Selectorless testing avoids this by focusing on the intent of the interaction rather than the implementation details.

### Benefits of Selectorless Testing:
1. **Reduced Maintenance**: Tests adapt to UI changes like text updates or class renaming.
2. **Human-Readable**: Tests are written in plain language, making them easier to understand and collaborate on.
3. **Cross-Platform**: Works on web, desktop, and mobile applications without requiring platform-specific selectors.

## Example: "Sign Up" Changing to "Register"

Imagine a scenario where a website updates its "Sign Up" button to say "Register." A traditional test relying on the text "Sign Up" would fail. With TestDriver's selectorless approach, the test adapts automatically.

### TestDriver YAML Example:```yaml
version: 4.2.18
steps:
  - prompt: Click the "Sign Up" button
    commands:
      - command: hover-text
        text: Sign Up
        description: button in the header for user registration
        action: click
  - prompt: Assert the registration form is displayed
    commands:
      - command: assert
        expect: The registration form is visible

```

### What Happens When "Sign Up" Changes to "Register"?

If the button text changes to "Register," TestDriver's AI vision will still locate the button based on its context and description. You don't need to update the test manually.

### Healing

TestDriver will update the test to reflect the new UI by modifing the `text` field. Then, it will open a new pull request with the changes.

```yaml
version: 4.2.18
steps:
  - prompt: Click the "Register" button
    commands:
      - command: hover-text
        text: Register
        description: button in the header for user registration
        action: click
  - prompt: Assert the registration form is displayed
    commands:
      - command: assert
        expect: The registration form is visible

```

## Key Takeaways:
- Selectorless testing focuses on **what the user sees** rather than **how the UI is implemented**.
- Tests are resilient to changes like text updates, class renaming, or minor layout adjustments.
- By using natural language and AI vision, TestDriver simplifies test creation and maintenance.
