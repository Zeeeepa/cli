---

This guide explains how to set up a basic GitHub Actions workflow to run tests using **TestDriver.ai**.

---

## Step 1: Prerequisites

1. **TestDriver.ai API Key**: Obtain your API key from TestDriver.ai and store it as a GitHub secret (e.g., `TESTDRIVER_API_KEY`).
2. **Test Files**: Ensure your test files are saved in the `testdriver/` directory of your repository.

---

## Step 2: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow

1. Create a new file in your repository: `.github/workflows/testdriver.yml`.
2. Add the following workflow configuration:

### Example Workflow: `.github/workflows/testdriver.yml`

```yaml
name: Run Tests with TestDriver.ai

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  run-tests:
    name: Run TestDriver.ai Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run TestDriver.ai
        uses: testdriverai/action@main
        with:
          key: ${{ secrets.TESTDRIVER_API_KEY }}
          prompt: |
            1. Run all tests in the testdriver directory
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          FORCE_COLOR: "3"


```


---

## Step 3: Add Your Test Files

1. Save your test files in the `testdriver/` directory of your repository.
2. Example test file: `testdriver/test.yml`:

```yaml
version: 4.2.18
steps:
  - prompt: Open the homepage
  - prompt: Verify the login button is visible
  - prompt: Click the login button
  - prompt: Verify the login form is displayed


```


---

## Step 4: Trigger the Workflow

1. Push changes to the `main` branch or open a pull request.
2. Alternatively, manually trigger the workflow from the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.

---

## Step 5: View Results

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
2. Select the workflow run to view the test results.

---

## Example Output

- ✅ **Run TestDriver.ai Tests**: All tests passed.
- ❌ **Run TestDriver.ai Tests**: 1 test failed. View logs for details.

By following this guide, you can quickly set up and run tests using TestDriver.ai on GitHub Actions.

# Debugging Tests in TestDriver.ai (app.testdriver.ai)

TestDriver.ai provides a powerful debugging interface through its **app.testdriver.ai** platform (formerly Dashcam). This interface allows you to analyze test runs, identify failures, and optimize your test suite with detailed visual and textual feedback.

---

## Key Features of app.testdriver.ai for Debugging

### 1. **Step-by-Step Execution Logs**
- View each step of the test execution, including:
  - The **action performed** (e.g., clicking a button, typing text).
  - The **expected outcome** (e.g., verifying a specific element is visible).
  - The **result** (pass, fail, or skipped).
- Logs provide detailed context for each step, making it easier to pinpoint where and why a test failed.

---

### 2. **Visual Feedback**
- **Screenshots**: See what the application looked like at each step of the test.
- **GIF Previews**: Watch a replay of the entire test execution to understand the flow and identify UI issues.
- **Highlighting**: Elements interacted with during the test are highlighted in screenshots, helping you verify that the correct elements were targeted.

---

### 3. **Error Details**
- For failed steps, app.testdriver.ai provides:
  - **Error messages**: Detailed descriptions of what went wrong (e.g., "Element not found").
  - **Stack traces**: For advanced debugging of backend or script-related issues.
  - **Suggestions**: Recommendations for fixing common issues, such as adjusting prompts or improving element descriptions.

---

### 4. **Test History**
- Access the history of test runs to:
  - Compare results across different builds or environments.
  - Identify flaky tests by analyzing patterns in failures.
  - Track improvements or regressions over time.

---

### 5. **Environment Context**
- View the environment details for each test run, including:
  - Operating system and browser version.
  - Screen resolution and viewport size.
  - Network conditions (if applicable).

---

### 6. **Collaboration Tools**
- Share test results with your team by generating a shareable link.
- Add comments or annotations to specific steps to facilitate discussions and debugging.

## How to Debug Tests in app.testdriver.ai

1. **Access Test Results**:
   - Navigate to [app.testdriver.ai](https://app.testdriver.ai).
   - Log in with your TestDriver.ai account.
   - Select the test run you want to debug from the dashboard.

2. **Analyze the Test Run**:
   - Review the **step-by-step logs** to identify where the test failed.
   - Use the **screenshots** and **GIF previews** to visually verify the application's behavior.

3. **Investigate Failures**:
   - Click on the failed step to view detailed error messages and suggestions.
   - Check the **highlighted elements** in the screenshots to ensure the correct elements were targeted.

4. **Iterate and Fix**:
   - Update your test prompts or application code based on the findings.
   - Re-run the test to verify the fix.

## Best Practices for Debugging in app.testdriver.ai

1. **Use Descriptive Prompts**:
   - Ensure your test prompts are clear and specific to reduce ambiguity.
   - Example: Instead of "Click the button," use "Click the 'Sign In' button in the header."

2. **Leverage Visual Feedback**:
   - Use screenshots and GIFs to quickly identify UI issues, such as misaligned elements or missing buttons.

3. **Track Flaky Tests**:
   - Use the test history to identify tests that fail intermittently and investigate potential causes (e.g., timing issues or dynamic content).

4. **Collaborate with Your Team**:
   - Share test results with developers and QA engineers to resolve issues faster.

5. **Optimize Test Steps**:
   - Combine or simplify test steps to make debugging easier and reduce test execution time.
