## Troubleshooting

###ÃŸ I don't have GitHub Copilot Chat

You can still use the extension to run and manage tests. Use the CLI for test creation instead.

### The @testdriver command doesn't show up

Make sure the GitHub Copilot Chat is set to "ask."

### How do I stop a running execution?

Depending on the context, you can stop a running test execution in several ways:

### 1. Click on the "Stop" button in the bottom of agent chat.

### 2. Click on the "Stop" button in the top right corner of the test execution. This only shows on hover.

### 3. A TestDriver icon will show in the tray bar. Click it, then click "quit."
