  extension.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize Your Project" stepNumber={1}>
    Set up your project with:

    ```bash
    npx testdriverai@latest init
    ```

    This creates a `.env` file and sample workflow files.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run TestDriver in Interactive Mode" stepNumber={2}>
    Start TestDriver in interactive mode to create and refine tests dynamically:

    ```bash
    npx testdriverai@latest
    ```

    Once started, you can use commands like `/explore`, `/run`, and `/save` to interactively build and test your flows.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Your Test Steps" stepNumber={3}>
    Use natural language to describe what you want to test. For example:

    ```
    > Open Google Chrome and search for "testdriverai"
    ```

    TestDriver will generate steps like:

    ```yaml
    - command: focus-application
      name: Google Chrome
    - command: hover-text
      text: Search Google or type a URL
      description: main search bar
      action: click
    - command: type
      text: testdriverai
    - command: press-keys
      keys:
        - enter
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine and Save Your Test" stepNumber={4}>
    - Save your test with `/save` to generate a reusable YAML file.
    - Use `/run` to run the test.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Saved Tests" stepNumber={5}>
    Once saved, you can run your test file anytime:

    ```bash
    npx testdriverai@latest run path/to/test.yaml
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

**Pro Tip:** Always start with interactive mode (`testdriverai`) to explore and refine your tests before saving them. It's faster and more intuitive\!
