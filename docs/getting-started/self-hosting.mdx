Self-hosting TestDriver allows you to run tests on your own infrastructure, giving you full control over the environment, security, and configurations. This guide walks you through setting up and managing self-hosted TestDriver instances using AWS.

## Why self host?

Self-hosting TestDriver gives you complete control over your test execution environment:

- **Enhanced security**: Get complete control over ingress and egress rules.
- **Complete customization**: Modify the TestDriver Golden Image (our pre-configured AMI) to include custom dependencies, software, and configurations at launch time.
- **Powerful Infrastructure**: Run tests on bare metal infrastructure that support emulators and simulators.

You'll use the [TestDriver CLI repository](https://github.com/testdriverai/cli) which contains all the infrastructure templates and setup scripts needed for self-hosting.

## Overview

By the end of this guide, you'll have a complete self-hosted testing infrastructure that can:

- Spawn TestDriver instances on-demand in your AWS account
- Run tests on your own AWS infrastructure with custom configurations
- Integrate seamlessly with GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
- Automatically clean up resources after test completion

The setup process involves three main steps:

1. **CloudFormation Infrastructure**: Deploy our `setup/aws/cloudformation.yaml` template to create the foundational AWS resources (VPC, security groups, IAM roles, and a launch template for instance creation).
2. **On-Demand Instance Spawning**: Use `setup/aws/spawn-runner.sh` with your Launch Template ID to programmatically spawn TestDriver instances whenever you need to run tests.
3. **GitHub Actions Integration**: Use `.github/workflows/self-hosted.yml` as a template for running tests in CI. This workflow demonstrates the complete lifecycle: spawning an instance, running tests, and shutting down the instance to minimize costs.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with permissions to run CloudFormation.
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed locally.

  <Tip>Be sure to run `aws configure` with your credentials</Tip>

- Access to the TestDriver AMI (Golden Image)\
  [Contact us with your preferred AWS Region for access](https://form.typeform.com/to/UECf9rDx?typeform-source=testdriver.ai).
- A GitHub repository for committing your tests & workflow.

## Step 1: Set Up AWS Infrastructure

### Deploy CloudFormation Stack

Our [`setup/aws/cloudformation.yaml`](https://github.com/testdriverai/cli/tree/main/setup/aws/cloudformation.yaml) template creates:

- Dedicated VPC with public subnet
- Security group with proper port access
- IAM roles and instance profiles
- EC2 launch template for programmatic instance creation

This is a one-time setup used to generate a template ID for launching instances.

```bash
# Deploy the CloudFormation stack
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file setup/aws/cloudformation.yaml \
  --stack-name my-testdriver-infrastructure \
  --parameter-overrides \
    ProjectTag=testdriver \
    AllowedIngressCidr=0.0.0.0/0 \
    InstanceType=c5.xlarge \
    CreateKeyPair=true \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

<Danger>
  **Security**: Replace `AllowedIngressCidr=0.0.0.0/0` with your specific IP
  ranges to lock down access to your VPC.
</Danger>

### Get Launch Template ID

After CloudFormation completes, find the launch template ID in the stack outputs:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name my-testdriver-infrastructure \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`LaunchTemplateId`].OutputValue' \
  --output text
```

<Tip>**Save this ID** – you'll need it for the next step.</Tip>

## Step 2: Spawn a New TestDriver Runner

This step is performed **every time you want to run tests**. The `spawn-runner.sh` script launches a new EC2 instance on-demand for test execution.

### Using spawn-runner.sh

Our [`setup/aws/spawn-runner.sh`](https://github.com/testdriverai/cli/tree/main/setup/aws/spawn-runner.sh) script:

- Launches a new EC2 instance using your launch template from Step 1
- Waits for the instance to become ready
- Completes the TestDriver handshake
- Returns instance details (IP, instance ID) for CLI usage

The script accepts parameters as either environment variables or CLI arguments:

```bash
# Launch an instance using environment variables
export AWS_REGION=us-east-2
export AMI_ID=ami-••••••••••  # Your TestDriver AMI (contact us to get one)
export AWS_LAUNCH_TEMPLATE_ID=lt-••••••••••  # From CloudFormation output from step 1
export RESOLUTION=1440x900 # Change screen resolution if desired (default is 1440x900)

/bin/bash ./setup/aws/spawn-runner.sh
```

The script outputs:

```
PUBLIC_IP=1.2.3.4
INSTANCE_ID=i-1234567890abcdef0
AWS_REGION=us-east-2
```

<Note>
  **Instance Lifecycle**: Instances spawned by this script will continue running
  until you manually terminate them. They are automatically tagged with
  `Name=TestDriverRunner` and `Project=[your ProjectTag value]` for easy
  identification in the AWS console.
</Note>

#### Changing Resolution in Lifecycle Files

You can also change the resolution before running tests by adding an `exec` command in your `lifecycle/provision.yaml` file:

```yaml lifecycle/provision.yaml
version: 6.0.0
steps:
  - prompt: set screen resolution
    commands:
      - command: exec
        lang: pwsh
        code: |
          C:\testdriver\SetResolution.ps1 -Width 1920 -Height 1080
```

This approach is useful when you need different resolutions for different test scenarios. See the [Lifecycle Files documentation](/guide/lifecycle) for more information about provision scripts.

### CLI Usage

Once you have an instance IP, run tests directly:

```bash
# Basic test execution
npx testdriverai@latest run test.yaml --ip=1.2.3.4
```

You can use the `PUBLIC_IP` to target the instance you just spawned via `./setup/aws/spawn-runner.sh`:

```sh
npx testdriverai@latest run testdriver/your-test.yaml \
  --ip="$PUBLIC_IP" \
```

### Terminating Instances

After your tests complete, terminate the instance to avoid unnecessary costs:

```bash
# Terminate the instance
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids $INSTANCE_ID --region $AWS_REGION
```

You can also terminate instances manually through the AWS console by searching for instances tagged with `Name=TestDriverRunner`.

## Step 3: GitHub Actions Integration

This step shows you how to automate the entire test lifecycle in CI/CD.

### Example Workflow

Our [`.github/workflows/self-hosted.yml`](https://github.com/testdriverai/cli/tree/main/.github/workflows/self-hosted.yml) demonstrates the complete workflow: spawning an EC2 instance, running your tests, and shutting down the instance automatically to minimize costs.

The workflow uses the GitHub secrets you configure (see below) to authenticate with AWS and spawn instances on-demand:

```yaml
name: TestDriver Self-Hosted

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup AWS Instance
        id: aws-setup
        run: |
          OUTPUT=$(./setup/aws/spawn-runner.sh | tee /dev/stderr)
          PUBLIC_IP=$(echo "$OUTPUT" | grep "PUBLIC_IP=" | cut -d'=' -f2)
          INSTANCE_ID=$(echo "$OUTPUT" | grep "INSTANCE_ID=" | cut -d'=' -f2)
          echo "public-ip=$PUBLIC_IP" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "instance-id=$INSTANCE_ID" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Run TestDriver
        run: |
          npx testdriverai run your-test.yaml \
            --ip="${{ steps.aws-setup.outputs.public-ip }}"
        env:
          TD_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TD_API_KEY }}

      - name: Shutdown AWS Instance
        if: always()
        run: |
          aws ec2 terminate-instances \
            --region ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}
            --instance-ids ${{ steps.aws-setup.outputs.instance-id }}
        env:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
		  AWS_REGION: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```

## AMI Customization

### Using the Base AMI

Our TestDriver Golden Image (AMI) comes pre-configured with everything you need to run tests:

**Operating System & Environment:**

- Windows Server with desktop environment
- VNC + web server for remote desktop access through the browser

**Development Tools:**

- Python (with pip)
- Node.js (with npm)
- Git

**Test Infrastructure:**

- TestDriver agent and dependencies
- Optimized settings for test execution
- Pre-configured networking for TestDriver CLI communication

### Modifying the AMI

You can customize the AMI for your specific needs:

1. **Launch an instance** from our base AMI
2. **Make your changes** (install software, configure settings)
3. **Create a new AMI** from your modified instance
4. **Update your workflow** to use the new AMI ID

### Amazon Image Builder

For automated AMI builds, use [Amazon EC2 Image Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/):

```yaml
# Example Image Builder pipeline
Components:
  - Name: testdriver-base
    Version: 1.0.0
    Platform: Windows
    Type: BUILD
    Data: |
      name: TestDriver Custom Setup
      description: Custom TestDriver AMI with additional software
      schemaVersion: 1.0
      phases:
        - name: build
          steps:
            - name: InstallSoftware
              action: ExecutePowerShell
              inputs:
                commands:
                  - "# Your custom installation commands here"
```

## Security Considerations

### Network Security

1. **Restrict CIDR blocks**: Only allow access from your known IP ranges
2. **Use VPC endpoints**: For private communication with AWS services
3. **Enable VPC Flow Logs**: For network monitoring and debugging

### AWS Authentication

Use [OIDC for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect) instead of long-term credentials:

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

steps:
  - name: Configure AWS credentials
    uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
    with:
      role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/GitHubActionsRole
      aws-region: us-east-2
```

### Instance Security

- **Terminate instances** immediately after use
- **Monitor costs** with AWS billing alerts
- **Use least-privilege IAM roles** for instance profiles
- **Enable CloudTrail** for audit logging

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Instance not responding in TestDriver CLI:**

When the CLI displays connection errors or timeouts, check:

- **Security group rules**: The CloudFormation template configures all necessary ports (RDP 3389, VNC 5900, and TestDriver communication ports). Verify your security group hasn't been modified.
- **Instance status checks**: Ensure the instance has passed both system and instance status checks in the AWS console.
- **AMI compatibility**: Verify the AMI is compatible with your selected instance type (some instance types don't support certain AMIs).

**Connection timeouts:**

- Verify network connectivity from runner to instance
- Check VPC routing and internet gateway configuration
- Confirm instance is in correct subnet

**AWS CLI errors:**

- Validate AWS credentials and permissions
- Check AWS service quotas and limits
- Verify region consistency across all resources
