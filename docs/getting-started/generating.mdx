## Step 1: Generate Test Plans Locally

### Run `/generate` Locally

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the following command to start TestDriver.ai locally:


```bash
testdriverai
> /generate web 10
```

This will generate 10 test plans for your website or application.

### Save the Generated Files

TestDriver.ai will save the generated test plans as YAML files in the `testdriver/generate/` directory by default. For example:

```
testdriver/
├── generate/
│   ├── test_1.yml
│   ├── test_2.yml
│   ├── test_3.yml
```
### Run  the test files
