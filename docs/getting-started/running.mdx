# Running Tests Locally with `/run` in TestDriver.ai

The `/run` command in TestDriver.ai allows you to execute previously created test plans locally. This is particularly useful for debugging, validating test scripts, or running tests in a controlled environment before committing them to a CI/CD pipeline.

---

## How to Use `/run`

1. **Navigate to Your Test Directory**:
Ensure you are in the directory where your test files are stored (e.g., `testdriver/`).

2. **Run a Specific Test File**:
Use the `/run` command followed by the path to the test file you want to execute. For example:

```bash
testdriverai
> /run testdriver/test.yml
```
This will execute the test plan defined in `test.yml`.

## Benefits of Running Tests Locally

1. **Quick Feedback**:
- Test changes immediately without waiting for CI/CD pipelines.
- Validate test scripts before committing them to version control.

2. **Debugging**:
- Identify and fix issues in test scripts or application behavior in a controlled environment.

3. **Offline Testing**:
- Run tests locally without requiring access to cloud-based runners or external environments.

4. **Iterative Development**:
- Modify test scripts and re-run them quickly to refine test cases.

## Example Workflow for Local Testing

1. **Create a Test File**:
Save the following YAML file as `testdriver/test.yml`:

```yaml
version: 4.2.18
steps:
  - prompt: Open the homepage
  - prompt: Verify the login button is visible
  - prompt: Click the login button
  - prompt: Verify the login form is displayed
```

2. **Run the Test Locally**:
Execute the test using the `/run` command:

```bash
testdriverai
> /run testdriver/test.yml   
```
