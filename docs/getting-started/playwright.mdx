## Overview

`@testdriver.ai/playwright` is a backwards-compatible wrapper around `@playwright/test` that uses TestDriver's Vision AI to:

- Make [natural language assertions](#assertions-with-expect-tomatchprompt)
- [Replace brittle selectors](#locating-elements-with-testdriver-locate) with natural language
- [Perform actions](#performing-actions-with-testdriver-act) with a prompt
- Test with an [automated agent](#agentic-tests-with-test-agent)

We'll be incrementally converting Playwright's example test from the sample code:

```typescript tests/example.spec.ts icon=square-js
// Before
test("get started link", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("https://playwright.dev/");
  await page.getByRole("link", { name: "Get started" }).click();
  await expect(
    page.getByRole("heading", { name: "Installation" }),
  ).toBeVisible();
});
```

To using natural language with TestDriver:

```typescript tests/example.spec.ts icon=square-js
// After
import { test } from "@testdriver.ai/playwright";

test.describe("get started link", () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => page.goto("https://playwright.dev/"));
  test.agent(`
    - Click the 'Get started' link
    - Verify the 'Installation' heading is visible
  `);
});
```

## Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a TestDriver Account">
    You will need a [TestDriver Pro](https://app.testdriver.ai/team) account (\$20/month) to get an API key.
    <Card title="Sign Up for TestDriver" icon="user-plus" horizontal href="https://app.testdriver.ai/team" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your environment">
    Copy your API key from [the TestDriver dashboard](https://app.testdriver.ai/team), and set it as an environment variable.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="macOS / Linux">

## Setup Playwright

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize Playwright">
    <Info>
      This is a condensed version of [Playwright's Installation Instructions](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro).

      **If you're new to Playwright, you should follow their guide first.**
    </Info>
    In a new folder or an existing, run:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="npm">
        ```bash
        npm init playwright@latest
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn create playwright
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm create playwright
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    Select the following options when prompted:

    ```console
    ✔ Do you want to use TypeScript or JavaScript?
    > TypeScript
    ✔ Where to put your end-to-end tests?
    > tests
    ✔ Add a GitHub Actions workflow? (y/N)
    > N
    ✔ Install Playwright browsers (can be done manually via 'npx playwright install')? (Y/n)
    > Y
    ```

    Then, confirm Playwright works by running:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="npm">
        ```bash
        npx playwright test
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn playwright test
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm exec playwright test
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setup `@testdriver.ai/playwright`

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install TestDriver">
    `@testdriver.ai/playwright` as a backwards-compatible wrapper around `@playwright/test`:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="npm">
        ```bash
        npm install @testdriver.ai/playwright
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn add @testdriver.ai/playwright
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm add @testdriver.ai/playwright
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Playwright">
    Before we start using TestDriver in our tests, run Playwright in [UI Mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode):

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="npm">
        ```bash
        npx playwright test --ui
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn playwright test --ui
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm exec playwright test --ui
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    ![Playwright UI Mode](https://playwright.dev/assets/ideal-img/ui-mode.4e54d6b.3598.png)

    Clicking the ▶️ button should successfully run the tests in the UI,
    just as they did before with `playwright test` in the CLI.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Import TestDriver">
    For the sake of simplicity, we'll be working with one test file for now.

    Open `tests/example.spec.ts` in your editor & rename the `@playwright/test`
    import to `@testdriver.ai/playwright`:

    ```typescript tests/example.spec.ts icon=square-js
    import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'; // [!code --]
    import { test, expect } from '@testdriver.ai/playwright'; // [!code ++]
    ```

    Click the <Icon icon="play" /> button to run the test and verify everything still works.

    <Tip>
      Click the <Icon icon="eye" /> button to automatically re-run tests on save.
    </Tip>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

Because TestDriver uses AI vision instead of selectors, we can use natural language for
[assertions](#assertions-with-expect-tomatchprompt),
[locating](#locating-elements-with-testdriver-locate),
performing [actions](#performing-actions-with-testdriver-act),
or even having an [agent](#agentic-tests-with-test-agent) test for you!

### Assertions with `expect.toMatchPrompt`

Replace `toBeVisible` with `toMatchPrompt` to assert that the element is visible on the screen:

```typescript tests/example.spec.ts icon=square-js
// [!code --:2]
// Expects page to have a heading with the name of Installation.
await expect(page.getByRole("heading", { name: "Installation" })).toBeVisible();
// [!code ++:2]
await expect(page).toMatchPrompt("'Installation' heading is visible");
```

Before, the test needed code comments to describe what the assertion is _actually checking_.

With `toMatchPrompt`, natural language acts as a description, selector, and assertion in one

<Tip>
  TestDriver can reduce the amount of complexity in your tests, but you can
  still "opt-in" to Playwright assertions and selectors if you need to (e.g.
  validating accessibility with `page.getByRole`).
</Tip>

### Locating elements with `testdriver.locate`

TestDriver can replace `data-testid`s, `getByRole`, and CSS selectors with natural language.

First, update your test to get access to the `testdriver` fixture:

```typescript tests/example.spec.ts icon=square-js
// [!code --]
test('get started link', async ({ page, }) => {
// [!code ++]
test('get started link', async ({ page, testdriver }) => {
```

Then, replace `getByRole` with `testdriver.locate`:

```typescript tests/example.spec.ts icon=square-js
test('get started link', async ({ page, testdriver }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

  // [!code --:2]
  // Click the get started link.
  await page.getByRole("link", { name: "Get started" }).click();
  // [!code ++:2]
  const link = await testdriver(page).locate("Get started link");
  await link.click();

  await expect(page).toMatchPrompt("'Installation' heading is visible");
```

Now, our test uses natural language to both describe & locate the element.

<Tip>
  In the example above, you can still use Playwright to assert that the element is indeed a link for accessibility:

```typescript tests/example.spec.ts icon=square-js
const link = await testdriver(page).locate("Get started link");
// [!code ++]
expect(link).toHaveRole("link");
await link.click();
```

This way you can write user-centric tests _and_ validate the implementation.

</Tip>

### Performing actions with `testdriver.act`

We can combine `locate` and `click` from the previous example into one line with `testdriver.act`:

```typescript tests/example.spec.ts icon=square-js
test("get started link", async ({ page, testdriver }) => {
  await page.goto("https://playwright.dev/");

  // [!code --:2]
  const link = await testdriver(page).locate("Get started link");
  await link.click();
  // [!code ++]
  await testdriver(page).act("Click the 'Get started' link");

  await expect(page).toMatchPrompt("'Installation' heading is visible");
});
```

Now the test uses the page the way a user would!

### Agentic tests with `test.agent`

TestDriver can automatically perform the entire test for you with an AI agent:

```typescript tests/example.spec.ts icon=square-js
// [!code --:6]
test("get started link", async ({ page, testdriver }) => {
  await page.goto("https://playwright.dev/");
  await testdriver(page).act("Click the 'Get started' link");
  await expect(page).toMatchPrompt("'Installation' heading is visible");
});

// [!code ++:7]
test.describe("get started link", () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => page.goto("https://playwright.dev/"));
  test.agent(`
    - Click the 'Get started' link
    - Verify the 'Installation' heading is visible
  `);
});
```

Instead of writing the test implementation, we've used [`test.describe`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-describe) to describe the test still,
but replaced the `test` itself with `test.agent`.

<Tip>
  Use `test.beforeEach` to prepare the page for the agent (e.g.
  [`page.goto`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-goto), calling
  an API to create a user). Use
  [`test.afterEach`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-after-each)
  to clean up after the agent (e.g. `page.close`) or perform additional logic
  (e.g. clearing the session).
</Tip>

## Conclusion

With `@testdriver.ai/playwright`, you can use as much or as little of Playwright's _or_ TestDriver's API as you need to validate correctness. It's up to you!
