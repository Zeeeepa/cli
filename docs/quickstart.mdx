<Steps>

<Step title="Install TestDriver">

Install the TestDriver CLI globally:  

```bash
npm install -g testdriverai@beta
```
</Step>

<Step title="Initialize Your Project">
Set up your project with:  
```bash
testdriverai init
```  
This creates a `.env` file and sample workflow files.
</Step>

<Step title="Run TestDriver in Interactive Mode">
Start TestDriver in interactive mode to create and refine tests dynamically:  
```bash
testdriverai
```  
Once started, you can use commands like `/explore`, `/undo`, and `/save` to interactively build and test your flows.
</Step>

<Step title="Define Your Test Steps">
Use natural language to describe what you want to test. For example:  
```
> Open Google Chrome and search for "testdriverai"
```
TestDriver will generate steps like:  
```yaml
- command: focus-application
  name: Google Chrome
- command: hover-text
  text: Search Google or type a URL
  description: main search bar
  action: click
- command: type
  text: testdriverai
- command: press-keys
  keys: [enter]
```
</Step>

<Step title="Refine and Save Your Test">
- Use `/undo` to remove the last step if needed.  
- Save your test with `/save` to generate a reusable YAML file.
</Step>

<Step title="Run Saved Tests">
Once saved, you can run your test file anytime:  
```bash
testdriverai run path/to/test.yaml
```
</Step>

</Steps>

**Pro Tip:** Always start with interactive mode (`testdriverai`) to explore and refine your tests before saving them. It's faster and more intuitive!
